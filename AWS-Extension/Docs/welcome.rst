AWS Tools for Team Services
###########################


The AWS Tools for Team Services, available through the 
`Visual Studio Marketplace <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/>`_ is an Visual Studio Team Services 
(VSTS) extension containing AWS build tasks. These tasks can be used in a VSTS project or on-premise 
Team Foundation Services environment. The tasks can be used, in whatever combinations needed, to build 
and release CI/CD pipelines, allowing those pipelines to interact with AWS services. For example a 
release pipeline can use the Deploy Application task for CodeDeploy to deploy the output from a build 
to a deployment group of EC2 instances managed by CodeDeploy. Other tasks allow content to be transferred 
between S3 buckets and the build area in the pipeline (upload and download), or to launch a CloudFormation 
stack or deploy to Elastic Beanstalk environments.
