   :keywords: extensions, tasks

Synopsis
========

Deletes an |CFNlong| stack.

Description
===========

Deletes the specified stack.

Parameters
==========

You can set the following parameters for the task. Required parameters are noted by an asterisk (*). Other parameters are optional.


Display name*
-------------

    The default name of the task instance, which can be modified: Delete Stack

AWS Credentials
---------------

    Specifies the AWS credentials to be used by the task in the build agent environment.

    You can specify credentials using a service endpoint (of type AWS) in the task configuration or you can leave unspecified. If
    unspecified the task will attempt to obtain credentials from the following sources in order:

    * From task variables named *AWS.AccessKeyID*, *AWS.SecretAccessKey* and optionally *AWS.SessionToken*.
    * From credentials set in environment variables in the build agent process. When using environment variables in the
      build agent process you may use the standard AWS environment variables: *AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID*, *AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY* and
      optionally *AWS_SESSION_TOKEN*.
    * If the build agent is running on an Amazon EC2 instance, from the instance metadata associated with the EC2 instance. For
      credentials to be available from EC2 instance metadata the instance must have been started with an instance profile referencing
      a role granting permissions to the task to make calls to AWS on your behalf. See IAMRolesForEC2_ for more information.

AWS Region
----------

    The AWS region code (us-east-1, us-west-2 etc) of the region containing the AWS resource(s) the task will use or create. For more
    information, see :aws-gr:`Regions and Endpoints <rande>` in the |AWS-gr|.

    If a region is not specified in the task configuration the task will attempt to obtain the region to be used using the standard
    AWS environment variable *AWS_REGION* in the build agent process's environment. Tasks running in build agents hosted on Amazon EC2
    instances (Windows or Linux) will also attempt to obtain the region using the instance metadata associated with the EC2 instance
    if no region is configured on the task or set in the environment variable.

    **Note:** The regions listed in the picker are those known at the time this software was released. New regions that are not listed
    may still be used by entering the *region code* of the region (for example *us_west_2*).

Stack Name*
-----------

    The name or unique ID of the stack to be deleted.
